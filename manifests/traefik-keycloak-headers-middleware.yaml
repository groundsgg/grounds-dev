# Traefik Middleware to ensure X-Forwarded-* headers are set correctly for Keycloak
# This is required for TLS termination (edge mode) to work properly with Keycloak cookies
# The middleware explicitly sets X-Forwarded-Proto to https and ensures headers are overwritten

    customRequestHeaders:
      X-Forwarded-Proto: "https"

    # Force overwrite existing headers to prevent header injection attacks
    # This ensures Keycloak always receives the correct protocol information
